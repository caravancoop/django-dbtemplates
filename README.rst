``dbtemplates`` is a Django app that consists of two parts:

1. It allows you to store templates in your database
2. It provides `template loader`_ that enables Django to load the
   templates from the database

It also features optional support for versioned storage and django-admin
command, integrates with Django's caching system and the admin actions.
